        <div class="news1">

        <p> <br> On March 12, 2025, former Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, born March 28, 1945, was placed in the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) following his arrest by Philippine authorities. This action was in response to an arrest warrant issued by Pre-Trial Chamber I, citing murder as a crime against humanity.</br>

            <br> The ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor had previously sought an arrest warrant on February 10, 2025, accusing Duterte of murder, torture, and rape as crimes against humanity. After reviewing the evidence, the Chamber—comprising Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc and Judges Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini-Gansou and María del Socorro Flores Liera—found sufficient grounds to believe that Duterte played a key role as an indirect co-perpetrator in the murder of civilians between November 1, 2011, and March 16, 2019.</br>
            
            <br> The Chamber concluded that these crimes were part of a deliberate attack on civilians, carried out as part of an organized policy while Duterte led the Davao Death Squad (DDS) and, later, as President of the Philippines. The widespread and systematic nature of these actions, spanning several years and resulting in thousands of deaths, was a key factor in the Chamber’s findings. The arrest warrant was based on a sample of incidents selected to aid in the legal assessment. </br>
            
            <br> Duterte is alleged to have directed or enabled the killing of individuals suspected of criminal activity, including drug offenders, first in Davao and later across the entire country. </br>
            
            <br> A court hearing will soon be scheduled to mark Duterte’s initial appearance before the ICC. During this session, the Chamber will confirm his identity, ensure he understands the charges against him, and verify the language in which he can follow the proceedings. The Court will also confirm that Duterte has been informed of his rights under the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty. </br>
            
            <br> ICC Registrar Osvaldo Zavala Giler expressed appreciation for the cooperation of the Philippine authorities, recognizing their commitment to international justice. He also thanked the Netherlands, the ICC’s host country, for its support. </br>
            
            <br> On May 24, 2021, the ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor requested permission from the Chamber to investigate alleged crimes linked to the Philippine government's “war on drugs” campaign, which took place from November 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019. The request was made public on June 14, 2021, and the Chamber authorized the investigation on September 15, 2021. </br>
            
            <br> Following a request by the Philippine government to suspend the probe, the ICC temporarily halted investigative activities. However, on July 18, 2023, the ICC Appeals Chamber ruled in favor of resuming the investigation.
            The Philippines became an ICC State Party on November 1, 2011, but formally submitted its withdrawal from the Rome Statute on March 17, 2018, with the exit taking effect on March 17, 2019. Despite this withdrawal, the ICC retains jurisdiction over crimes committed while the country was still a State Party. </br> </p>

        <h3 id="news2">Boxing Set to Return to 2028 Olympics After Governance Disputes</h3>

        <p>  <br>COSTA NAVARINO, Greece — Boxing is expected to be included in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, following years of controversy over the sport’s governance. </br>
            <br>International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach announced on Monday that the executive board had approved boxing’s place in the 2028 program. The final confirmation must come from the full IOC Session, which consists of about 100 members, but this is typically a routine approval. </br>
            <br>In recent years, the IOC has been overseeing Olympic boxing tournaments, including those in Tokyo (2021) and Paris (2024), after severing ties with the International Boxing Association (IBA), which was led by Russia. However, the IOC emphasized the need for a new governing body before the 2028 Games. Last month, it officially recognized World Boxing as that entity. </br>
            <br>“I am confident the session will approve this decision, providing clarity for boxers worldwide that they can compete at the LA 2028 Olympics, provided their national federation is recognized by World Boxing,” Bach stated. </br>
            <br>The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019 due to governance issues, financial concerns, and questions about the integrity of judging. In 2023, the IOC took the unprecedented step of completely expelling the IBA from the Olympic movement. That same year, some IBA members broke away to form World Boxing. </br>
            <br>Despite the suspension, the IBA and its Russian president, Umar Kremlev, have continued to clash with the IOC, particularly regarding eligibility rules for female boxers at the Paris Olympics. Last month, the IBA announced plans to take legal action against the IOC in the U.S., France, and Switzerland. </br>
            <br>World Boxing is now focused on updating eligibility rules for female athletes, which must be finalized before Olympic qualifiers begin, likely next year. </br>
            <br>“This is a crucial decision for Olympic boxing and moves the sport closer to being fully reinstated in the Olympic program,” World Boxing President Boris van der Vorst said in a statement. “I’m confident this news will be welcomed by the global boxing community, as it ensures boxing remains part of the Olympic movement.” </br>
            <br>World Boxing was founded in 2023 with the backing of key figures from the U.S. and U.K. and has since gained support from influential Olympic nations, including India and, more recently, China. The organization now has over 80 national federations as members, though some countries—such as Russia, Spain, and several African nations—have not yet joined. </br>
            <br>The IOC indicated that national boxing federations will have time to transition to World Boxing before Olympic qualifying events begin. </br>
            <br>Like the IBA, the Russian Olympic Committee remains suspended by the IOC. The Russian body was sanctioned in October 2023 after it took control of sports councils in eastern Ukraine, a move the IOC said violated Ukraine’s territorial integrity. </br>
            <br> “The next move is up to the Russian Olympic Committee,” Bach stated, emphasizing that while communication at the working level has continued, Russia must comply with IOC rules. The Russian Olympic Committee has also been cut off from receiving Olympic revenue for nearly 18 months due to these violations. </br>
            <br>  “Everyone in the Olympic Movement who follows the rules of the Olympic Charter is welcome,” Bach said. “Those who do not are not welcome.” </br> </p>

        <h4 id="news3">Philippines Posts Largest BOP Surplus in Five Months Amid Foreign Borrowings</h4>

        <p> <br> MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines registered its largest balance of payments (BOP) surplus in five months this February, reversing a four-month deficit streak. The improvement was primarily driven by inflows from the Marcos administration’s recent offshore bond issuance.  <br>

            <br> According to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the country posted a BOP surplus of $3.1 billion last month, a significant recovery from the $4.1-billion deficit recorded in January. This marks the highest surplus since September 2024, when it reached $3.53 billion. The latest surplus increases the country’s available dollar reserves for international transactions, reducing the year-to-date BOP deficit to $992 million. </br>

            <br> The BSP projects a full-year BOP surplus of $2.1 billion for 2025, equivalent to 0.4% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). </br>

            <br> The central bank attributed February’s positive performance to the government’s foreign borrowings, including $3.25 billion raised from U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated bonds issued in late January. Gains from BSP’s overseas investments also contributed to the surplus. </br>

            <br> Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael Ricafort said sustained growth in structural dollar inflows is expected to further strengthen the country’s BOP position in the coming months. </br>

            <br> The improved BOP also boosted the Philippines’ gross international reserves (GIR), which rose to $107.4 billion in February from $103.3 billion the previous month. This reserve level provides a financial buffer equivalent to 7.4 months’ worth of imports and payments for services and primary income. It is also sufficient to cover 3.8 times the country’s short-term external debt based on residual maturity. </br>

            <br> By international standards, a GIR covering at least three months of imports is considered adequate. The BSP forecasts the country’s reserves to reach $110 billion by the end of 2025. </br> </p>

        <p>  <br>COTABATO CITY, Philippines — A female lawyer was killed while her fiancé, also a lawyer, was seriously injured after being ambushed by armed men in Barangay Awang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao del Norte, on Monday afternoon. </br>

        <p> <br> MANILA, Philippines — Northern and Eastern  Samar are expected to experience heavy to intense rainfall until Friday due to the effects of the shear line, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) reported early Thursday.  </br>

            <br> According to PAGASA weather specialist Rhea Torres, cloud formations have been observed over the eastern sections of the Visayas, as well as parts of MIMAROPA (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan) and the Bicol Region.  </br>
            
            <br> “These weather disturbances are caused by the shear line, which results from the convergence of hot and cold air. This will bring moderate to heavy rainfall over these areas,” Torres warned.  </br>
            
            <br> Meanwhile, the northeast monsoon or “amihan” is expected to affect Cagayan Valley, Apayao, Aurora, Quezon, and the rest of the Bicol Region, bringing cloudy skies and rain over the next 24 hours.  </br>
            
            <br> In Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon, the northeast monsoon will bring partly cloudy to overcast skies with isolated light rains.  </br>
            <br> For the rest of the country, similar cloud patterns are expected, with isolated rain showers and thunderstorms due to the influence of easterly winds, PAGASA added.  </br> </p>
